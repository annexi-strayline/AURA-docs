*Systemize*
===========

Systemize is used for converting existing ``local`` type repositories into :ref:`system-type repositories <concepts_repositories_system_type>`.

.. note::

  This command is not yet implemented.

.. warning::

  Systemize, like the ``system`` repository type, is experimental. It is increasingly possible that this feature will be either removed or completely re-worked in the future.


Usage
-----

.. prompt:: bash $

  aura systemize [-repo-add/show] [-debug] [-assertions] [-optimize-1/2/3/size/debug] destination_path

The ``systemize`` command builds a :ref:`system repository <concepts_repositories_system_type>` subsystem, and installs it at a directory specified by ``destination_path``. This directory shall be a subdirectory of a repository that is designated as a ``system`` type repository.

The ``systemize`` command will ultimately create an Ada-specific shared library and a set of specifications (and in the case of GNAT, ``.ali`` files) for each subsystem in the project, which will be installed into the matching subdirectories at ``destination_path``.

The ``systemize`` command implicitly invokes :doc:`compile </cli/compile_command>`.

.. warning::
  Users of a ``system`` repository cannot use configuration units for subsystems contained in that repository. 

.. note::
  The shared library objects generated by ``systemize`` do not contain Ada elaboration code, or an Ada runtime. These libraries are intended to be used exclusively by Ada applications, and by a compiler that knows how to use these types of shared libraries.

  When using a system library, the Ada compiler will generate the appropriate elaboration code to elaborate the the subsystems.

Options
~~~~~~~

-repo-add
  This causes a new repository configuration unit, pointing to the newly created system repository, to be added to the project.

-repo-show
  This causes the contents needed to create a repository configuration unit to be output to STDOUT. 

  This is the default.

-debug, -assertions -optimize-(1/2/3/size/debug)
  These options are passed to the ``compile`` invocation. See :ref:`compile <ref_compile_command_options>`
